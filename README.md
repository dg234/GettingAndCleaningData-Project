==============================
**Introduction**:  
This repo/project is for the "Getting and cleaning data" coursera course.  The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

**Instructions**:

1.  Clone this repository
2.  Change the working directory to GettingAndCleaningData-Project/ folder
3.  Download the data source zip file
4.  Unzip the source zip file: unzip getdata-projectfiles-UCI\ HAR\ Dataset.zip
5.  Source/Run run_analysis.R
  
The code has been tested on Mac OSX and might have to be adapted for other operating systems.

**Output**:  
__run_analysis.R__ generates the __tidy_data.txt__ file:

tidy_data.txt: contains mean and standard deviation for each measurements from the training and test data sets
